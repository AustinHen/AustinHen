## Hi, I'm Austin 
I am a Computer Science graduate from UMass Amherst   

Here is some code that I wrote. Click on the links to read more detailed project descriptions. 

### Solo Projects:

- [Web Browser Engine:](https://github.com/AustinHen/Web-Browser) A web browser written from scratch. Handles networking, page rendering, and more.

- [P2P file downloaded](https://github.com/AustinHen/P2P-File-Downloader) Based loosely on bit torrent. The idea is that, instead of storing files on a central server, files are broken up into blocks and stored on several end users' machines.

- [PyTorch Visualizer:](https://github.com/AustinHen/pytorch-net-visualizer-) Graphs the topology of neural networks.

- [Video Playback Speed Editor](https://github.com/AustinHen/VideoPlaybackSpeed) Browser plugin that lets you change playback speeds to anything you want - I  made this because existing plugins did not work with Echo360 (my school's lecture recording platform)

- [Personal Site](https://austinhen.github.io/) My personal website. It has the same information as this page but styled better.
